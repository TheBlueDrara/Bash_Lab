### Homework yeepee


## Nothing much to say, part of the homework was done in an old fashion way and the rest is done as a script.


# Daily WarHammer40K quote - 

```
From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me.
I craved the strength and certainty of steel. 
I aspired to the purity of the Blessed Machine.
Your kind cling to your flesh, as though it will not decay and fail you.
```
